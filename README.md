# Requirement Analysis in Software Development
Requirement analysis is where you gather, analyze, and define requirements of the software product to be developed.
- It helps understand what is expected of the system and its performance

## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement analysis is the process of determining the needs and expectations of a new or modified system, particularly in software engineering.

### Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
Requirement analysis:
* Provides clarity on what the stakeholders expect from the product, thereby reducing ambiguity.
* Helps clearly define the scope of the project (prevents scope creep).
* Provides a basis for designing and developing the software.
* Allows accurate estimation of project cost, time, and resources.
* Ensures the final product meets the specified requirements, resulting in higher customer satisfaction.

### Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
- Requirement gathering – Through interviews, surveys, questionnaires, workshops, observations, and document analysis.
- Requirement elicitation – Generate ideas, gather detailed reqs, refine requirements, or visualize the system through brainstorming, focus groups, prototyping.
- Requirement documentation – Create requirement specification document ( detailed doc listing all functional and non-functional reqs), user stories (stories describing the functionalities from the user’s perspective), and use cases (to showcase interactions between users and the system).
- Requirement analysis and modeling – Req. prioritization (prioritizing reqs based on importance and impact), feasibility analysis (use the technical, financial, and time constraints to assess the feasibility of the reqs), and modelling (create models like ERDs or data flow diagrams to visualize and analyze reqs).
- Requirement validation – Include Review and Approval, defining acceptance criteria, and traceability.

### Types of Requirements
- Functional Requirements – Describes what the software should do. For example, user authentication, booking system, user registration, property search, etc.
- Non-functional requirements – Describes how the system should perform. This includes its performance, security, usability, scalability, and reliability.
